## 🪐 What's "Aritim Dark"?
It's my take on [Mrcuve0's](https://github.com/Mrcuve0) [Aritim Dark](https://github.com/Mrcuve0/Aritim-Dark) theme for KDE and GTK based Desktop Environments. I've copied the Ayu Dark color palette into Apple's Terminal format.

It's not perfect, but it's good enough for me 🤷‍♂️
